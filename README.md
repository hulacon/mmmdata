# MMMData

MMMData refers to the Multi-Modal Memory Dataset. The Multi-Modal Memory Dataset is a dense (many observations for a smaller number of participants) fMRI study being conducted at the University of Oregon. The goal is to better understand how the brain remembers sights and sounds and how doing so in traditional, experimental settings (unrelated, discrete series of trials) relates to doing so in more naturalistic settings (i.e., watching and recalling a video).
